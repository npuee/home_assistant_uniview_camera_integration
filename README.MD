Multithreaded python script to turn on/off Unioview cameras intelegent detection.

Reason: I have a lot of Uniview cameras that have "intellegent" motion/intrudion detection bot no easy way to switch it of or on.
It's annoying when camera flashes everytime someone is outside.
So here is the solution:

Setup "intelelgent" detection rule on cameras.
Add script to home assistant and you have a pretty button to switch detection of or on.
